# routeSetter
client/server application to add routes on behalf of unprivileged processes

This is a set of scripts that you can use to dynamically replace routes based on the common name of an openvpn client.
It is basically a template for you to look at and base your own workarounds for unprivileged processes on.
Have fun.
